## Python | Learn Flash to make out site

Flask is a small web framework written in **Python**. It's classified as a microframework because it doesn't require particular tools or libraries, keeping a simple yet extensible core. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. There are extensions to object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and several common framework-related tools.
